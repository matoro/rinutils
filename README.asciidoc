Introduction
------------

This is a set of C headers containing macros and static functions that
are expected to work on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like[Unix-like systems]
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows[MS Windows] that have
been extracted from https://www.shlomifish.org/[Shlomi FishÂ´s projects].

They are quite random and task specific and may not work for you.

**Note:** we only support the https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html[`-std=gnu11`]
dialect as supported by GCC, clang and compatible compilers. Other compilers
are not supported.
